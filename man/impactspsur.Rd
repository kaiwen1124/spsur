\description{
This function is a wrapper for \code{\link[spatialreg]{impacts}} method
  used in \pkg{spatialreg} package. Nevertheless, in this case the same 
  method is used for both \code{\link[spatialreg]{lagsarlm}} and 
  \code{\link[spatialreg]{lmSLX}} objects. For details of implementation, 
  see the documentation of \code{\link[spatialreg]{impacts}} function in 
  \pkg{spatialreg} package. \cr
  The function obtains the multiplier effects, on the explained variable, 
  of a change in a regressor for the model that has been estimated. 
  For reasons given below, this function only applies to models with an 
  autoregressive structure ("slm", "sdm", "sarar" and "gnm") or with spatial lags 
  of the regressors ("slx", "sdem"). \cr
  The measurement of the multiplier effects is a bit more complicated than 
  in a pure time series context because, due to the spatial structure of 
  the model, part of the impacts spills over non uniformly over the space. 
  Using the notation introduced by LeSage and Pace (2009) we distinguish 
  between:
  \itemize{
    \item \strong{Average Direct effects}: The average over the \emph{N} 
    spatial units and \emph{Tm} time periods of the effect of a unitary 
    change in the value of a explanatory variable on the contemporaneous 
    value of the corresponding explained variable, located in the same 
    point of the intervened regressor. This calculus is solved for all the 
    regressors that appear in the \emph{G} equations of the model.
    \item \strong{Average Indirect effects}: The average over the \emph{N} 
    spatial units and \emph{Tm} time periods of the effects of a unitary 
    change in the value of a explanatory variable on the contemporaneous 
    value of the corresponding explained variable, located in a different 
    spatial unit that that of the intervened regressor. This calculus is 
    solved for all the regressors that appear in the \emph{G} equations of 
    the model.
    \item \strong{Average total effects}: The sum of Direct and 
    Indirect effects.
  }

   The information on the three estimated effects is supplement with an 
   indirect measure of statistical significance obtained from the 
   randomization approach introduced in LeSage and Pace (2009).
}
\details{
LeSage and Pace (2009) adapt the classical notion of 
 \emph{'economic multiplier'} to the problem of measuring the impact that 
 a unitary change in the value of a regressor, produced in a certain point 
 in space, has on the explained variable. The question is interesting 
 because, due to the spatial structure of the model, the impacts of such 
 change spill non uniformly over the space. In fact, the reaction of the 
 explained variable depends on its relative location in relation to the 
 point of intervention. \cr
 To simplify matters, LeSage and Pace (2009) propose to obtain aggregated 
 multipliers for each regressor, just averaging the \eqn{N^{2}} impacts 
 that results from intervening the value of each regressor on each of the
 N points in Space, on the explained variable, measured also in each of 
 the \eqn{N} points in space. This aggregated average is the so-called 
 \emph{Total effect}. \cr
 Part of this impact will be absorved by the explained variable located in 
 the same point of the regressor whose value has been changed (for example, 
 the k-th regresor in the g-th equation, in the n-th spatial unit) or,
 in other words, we expect that \eqn{[d y_{tgn}]/[d x_{ktgn}] ne 0}. The 
 aggregated average for the \emph{N} points in space (n=1,2,...,N) and 
 \emph{Tm} time periods is the so-called \emph{Direct effect}.
 The difference between the \emph{Total effect} and the \emph{Direct effect} 
 measures the portion of the impact on the explained variable that leakes 
 to other points in space, \eqn{[d y_{tgn}]/[d x_{ktgm}] for n ne m};
 this is the \emph{Indirect effect}.

 \code{\link{impacts}} obtains the three multipliers together with an 
 indirect measure of statistical significance, according to the 
 randomization approach described in Lesage and Pace (2009). Briefly, they 
 suggest to obtain a sequence of \emph{nsim} random matrices of order 
 \emph{(NTmxG)} from a multivariate normal distribution 
 N(0; \emph{Sigma}), being \emph{Sigma} the estimated covariance matrix 
 of the \emph{G} equations in the SUR model. These random matrices, 
 combined with the observed values of the regressors and the estimated 
 values of the parameters of the corresponding spatial SUR model, are used 
 to obtain simulated values of the explained variables. Then, for each one 
 of the \emph{nsim} experiments, the SUR model is estimated, and the effects
 are evaluated. The function \code{\link{impacts}} obtains the standard 
 deviations of the \emph{nsim} estimated effects in the randomization 
 procedure, which are used to test the significance of the estimated 
 effects for the original data.

 Finally, let us note that this is a SUR model where the \emph{G} equations 
 are connected only through the error terms. This means that if we 
 intervene a regressor in equation \emph{g}, in any point is space, only 
 the explained variable of the same equation \emph{g} should react. The 
 impacts do not spill over equations. Moreover, the impact of a regressor, 
 intervened in the spatial unit \emph{n}, will cross the borders of this 
 spatial unit only if in the right hand side of the equation there are 
 spatial lags of the explained variables or of the regressors. In other 
 words, the \emph{Indirect effect} is zero for the "sim" and "sem" models. 
 \code{\link{impacts}} produces no output for these two models.
 Lastly, it is clear that all the impacts are contemporaneous because the 
 equations in the SUR model have no time dynamics.
