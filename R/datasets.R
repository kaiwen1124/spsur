#'   \cr
#'   \cr
#' The mobility indices Within and Exits has been obtain as ratio of the total number of weekly travels
#' in reference to the total number of travels in the week of reference (week0). \cr
#' In particular, 
#' \cr 
#' \cr 
#'  \eqn{
#'  Within = \frac{\textnormal{Number of travels within the province 
#'  'indiv' in the week 'time'}} 
#'   {\textnormal{Number of travels within the province 'indiv' in the 
#'   reference week (week0)}} }
#'   \cr 
#'   \cr 
#'   \eqn{
#'   Exits = \frac{ 
#'     \begin{tabular}{c}
#'       \textnormal{Number of travels with origin in the 
#'                   province 'indiv' and arrival to another} \\
#'       \textnormal{province in the week 'time'} 
#'     \end{tabular} } 
#'   { \begin{tabular}{c}
#'       \textnormal{Number of travels with origin in the province 
#'                   'indiv' and arrival to another} \\

#'   \cr 
#'   \cr
#'   A ‘travel’ is a displacement from an origin to a destination of at least 500m. A travel can have several stages.
#'   These stages of the same travel are calculated based on the duration of the intermediate stop. For example
#'   , if I move from origin A to destination B with a stop at a point C of long duration, it
#'   is considered two travels, but if the stop is short, it is considered a single travel. For example,
#'   I can go by train from Madrid to Alicante, and there takes a bus to Benidorm. The travel will be one
#'   (Madrid-Benidorm). If I do the same but the stop in Alicante is long (or an overnight stay, for example),
#'   two travels will be considered (Madrid-Alicante, and Alicante-Benidorm). Similarly, if I go by car from
#'   Madrid to Alicante and stop for 15 minutes to take a coffee, it is also considered only one travel and not two.
#'   The travels considered in this study are always from 500m, due to the limitation of source data that is based
#'   on mobile telephony and its antennas. But one travel can be 600 meters or 600km.

#'   healthcare, food supply, State security, media and communication, refuse collection, management and public transport, etc.
#'   Non essential activities are by example, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers, etc. A full list in the Spanish official bulletin
